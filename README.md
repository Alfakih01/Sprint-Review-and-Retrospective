# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You first have to Understand the user's needs by actively listening and asking questions. Those needs are then translated into technical requirements. Use simplicity and clarity to ensure the program effectively solves the user's problems.

User stories help simplify complex requirements by shifting the focus to the user's perspective. They describe what the user wants to achieve, helping developers create features that directly address user needs and priorities.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The best way is to start by understanding the project's goal. Break down complex requirements of the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Prioritize flexibility and continuous improvement. Regularly test and refine based on feedback.

I plan to use agile methodologies like Scrum. Mainly because of the flexibility it offers, it emphasizes iterative development, where you build in small increments and adjust based on ongoing feedback. Focus on collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates clearly and regularly. They Share knowledge and learn from others. They are reliable and meet your commitments. They contribute positively to the team and are open to feedback and new ideas.
